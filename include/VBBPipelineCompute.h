/*
    This is the base pipeline class. It contains common handles, data structures, and methods that will be common
    to all rendering pipelines. This is meant to be a  virutal base class, and child pipelines must
    implement or override all other functionality. It is functional by itself, but will just display
    a blank screen.

    The idea here is to make it easy to derive a custom pipeline, but also, and perhaps more importatnly, to
    have an inventory of STOCK PIPELINES for common rendering tasks.

    Pipelines need to export what vertex data and uniforms are supposed to look like.
